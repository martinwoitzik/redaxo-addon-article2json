redaxo-addon-article2json
=========================

Adds optional JSON-Output to Redaxo-CMS-Sites which can be configured in the backend.<br/>


#Install
Put all files in a separate folder and copy the whole folder to the */redaxo/addons/* directory.<br/>
After that log into your backend and activate the addon.

You will see a new menuitem on the sidebar which is called "REX2JSON".<br/>If you click on it you will be able to declare a specific JSON-Output to every module that is defined in your backend.<br/><br/>
**NOTE:** If there are no modules available nothing can be edited!
